# Onboarding-Programming-Assignments
This repository contains the onboarding assignments completed as part of my introductory work. It includes small programs written in Python, Java, and Node.js. Each program is designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts in each language.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- `Python/`: Contains the Python program to check for vowels in a string and determine if a number is prime.
- `Java/`: Contains the Java program to check for vowels in a string and determine if a number is prime.
- `NodeJs/`: Contains the Node.js (JavaScript) program to check for vowels in a string and determine if a number is prime.

## Programs

### 1. Check if a Vowel is Present in the String

This program takes a user input string and checks whether it contains any vowels (a, e, i, o, u).

### 2. Check if the Given Number is Prime

This program takes a user input number and determines whether it is a prime number.
